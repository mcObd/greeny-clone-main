     <blockquote>THE MAN WHO "THOUGHT" HIS WAY INTO PARTNERSHIP WITH THOMAS A. EDISON
    TRULY, "thoughts are things," and powerful things at that, when they are mixed
     with definiteness of purpose, persistence, and a BURNING DESIRE for their 
     translation into riches, or other material objects. A little 
         more than thirty years ago, Edwin C. Barnes discovered how true it
         is that men really do THINK AND GROW RICH. His discovery did not 
        come about at one sitting. It came little by little, beginning with a
         BURNING DESIRE to become a business associate of the great Edison. 
         One of the chief characteristics of Barnes' Desire was that it 
         was definite. He wanted to work with Edison, not for him. Observe,
         carefully, the description of how he went about translating his
         DESIRE into reality, and you will have a better understanding of the 
         thirteen principles which lead to riches,When this DESIRE, or impulse of
         thought, first flashed into his mind he was in no position to act upon it. 
         Two difficulties stood in his way. He did not know Mr. Edison, and he did 
         not have enough money to pay his railroad fare to Orange, New Jersey. 
         These difficulties were sufficient to have discouraged
         the majority of men from making any attempt to carry out the desire. 
         But his was no ordinary desire! He was so determined to find a way to 
        carry out his desire that he finally decided to travel by "blind baggage," 
        rather than be defeated. (To the uninitiated, this means that he went to East
         Orange on a freight train). He presented himself at Mr. Edison's laboratory, 
         and announced he had come to go into business with the inventor. In speaking
          of the first meeting between Barnes and Edison, years later, Mr. Edison said, 
          "He stood there before me, looking like an ordinary tramp, but there was 
          something in the expression of his face which conveyed the impression that 
          he was determined to get what he had come after. I had learned, from years of 
          experience with men, that when a man really DESIRES a thing so deeply that
          he is willing to stake his entire future on a single turn of the wheel in 
          order to get it, he is sure to win. I gave him the opportunity he asked for,
           because I saw he had made up his mind to stand by until he succeeded. 
           Subsequent events proved that no mistake was made.</blockquote>

<del style="color:violet">Just what young Barnes said to Mr. Edison on that occasion was far less important than that which he thought. Edison, himself, said so! It could not have been the young man's appearance which got him his start in the Edison office, for that was definitely against him. It was what he THOUGHT that counted.</del>
<p>If the significance of this statement could be conveyed to every person who reads it, there would be no need for the remainder of this book.</p>
